            <article><h4><span id="date">December 2021</span></h4>As of December 2021, I've completed my first semester of CUNY Tech Prep and presented <a href="http://nichely.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Nichely</a> 
                with my excellent team during CTP Demo Night on December 14. The pitch video may also be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimZ11f0-iA" target="_blank">here</a>.
                I have also recently received news that I have been accepted into the <a href="https://projectbasta.com/students/" target="_blank">Basta Fellowship's</a> newest cohort; I 
                will be able to network with other first-generation college students and attend workshops to build my professional development skills. In the meantime, I will continue 
                interning at my school's <a href="https://techincubatorqc.com/" target="_blank">Tech Incubator</a> and create apps and websites to promote my clients' businesses.

            <article><h4><span id="date">September 2021</span></h4>As of September 2021, I've completed my first ever summer internship with CUNY Welcome Corps
                to create an <a href="http://fye.qc.cuny.edu/fye-simulator-game/" target="_blank">educational text-simulator game</a> for first year-students at Queens College. At the
                same time, I've been granted the role of <strong>Workshop Developer</strong> at my school's coding club
                <a href="https://rsqc.github.io/" target="_blank">Code Resolve</a>, in which I'm responsible for
                organizing club activities and teaching members how to code various projects.
                On top of my classes, I am a web development fellow with <a href="https://cunytechprep.nyc/" target="_blank">CUNY Tech Prep</a>;
                I will explore effective full stack development practices and collaborate on a meaningful web application with my classmates.
